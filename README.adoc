* Launch Cadint and "Create New PCB Design" +
  Save as desired Name.
* From Menubar "Add PCB Design as a Component" +
  This is the PCB Design which is to be Panelised and looks like the following. +

* From Menubar select "Tools -> Panel Editor" to launch the "Panel Editor" +
  Select the "Panel Utility" +
  Leave "Outline Force" as is +
  Set "Outline Expand" "LEFT". "TOP", "RIGHT" and "BOTTOM" to 12 mm. +
  Set "Step Boards" "X Steps=4", "Y Steps=1", "X Spacing=2", "Y Spacing=2" and "Angle=0" +
  Select "Step and Expand Panel" +
* Close Panel Editor to generate the Panelised PCB.
* The Panel Image of Four PCBs is now displayed in the Panel as Follows.

* Remove the "V Groove Route Traces" from the panel. They will be replaced with "Routed Slots" and "Breakout Sections" +
  Hit "V" shortcut to Display the Visible Layers. +
  Select "Set on exclude"->"Panel Routing Unplated" followed by "OK" button. +
  From Cadint Menubar Select "Delete" and group select all "Panel Routing Unplated" lines. +
  Press "OK" to delete all of the lines. +
  Restore all layers using "V" and "Set on ALL" followed by "OK". +

* Move the "Panel Outline" to the desired postion of the "Primary Fiducial"
  In our example this is 6 mm directly below the "Lower Left" corner of the first board. +
  This is achieved as follows: +
    A. Gain access to the "Panel local library" by doing a query on "Board 1 Component" +
    B. In "Local Library" Right Click and open "BOARD.DEFAULT" +
    C. Move "MinBoard" and "Panel Outline" lines by X=-12 and Y=-6 +
    D. Move "MaxBoard" to be on "Upper Right" corner of "Panel Outline". +
    E. Close and "save" "BOARD.DEFAULT". +
    F. Open/Load "BOARD.DEFAULT" +
    G. Ignore "Match Alternative" warning and press "OK" +
    H. Now move all Panel Components by X=-12 and Y=-6 mm +
    
* The Panel should now look like the following

* Add the "Primary Fiducial" to the Panel. +
  From "Cadint Menubar" press "Add"->"PCB Component by Symbol". +
  Navigate to the "PCB Symbol Library"->"Fiducials" and select "Fiducial1" +
  Place it at the "Origin" of the Panel. +
  Query Fiducial and "Add New Property" as "PP_FIDUCIAL=PRIMARY" +
  Add "Secondary Fiducial" from Library and place it for "Board 2" +
  Query Fiducial and "Add New Property" as "PP_FIDUCIAL=SECONDARY" +
  Place a Copy of the "Secondary Fiducial" at the remaining corners of all Four Boards +

* The Panel should now look like the following

* Add "Breakout Section" "Symbols" to the Panel. +
  From the Menubar "Add"->"PCB Component by Symbol" and navigate to "PCB Symbol Library"->"Panel". +
  Select "BREAKOUT.2x2mm" and place around each "Board Component" as shown in the Panel below +
  
* The Panel with the "Breakout.2x2mm" Symbols added looks like this:

* Add "Routed Slots" between all the "Breakout.2x2mm" Symbols: +
  From the Cadint Menubar Select "Add"->"Primitives"->"Wideline" +
  Select "Line Attributes" of "Layer="Panel Routing Unplated" and "Width=2mm" +
  Place between all "BREAKOUT.2x2mm" symbols with start and finish offset by 2mm from centres.
  
* The Panel should now look like the following

image::images/PanelWithRoutedSlots.gif[Panel with Routed Slots added]

* Add Panel Tooling Holes as follows +
  From the Cadint Menubar Select "Add"->"Primitives"->"Drill Hole" with Attributes "Layer=Hole Type 2", "Diam=4mm" +
  Place four holes 5mmx5mm inside corners and two holes at TOP-LEFT of Board1 and RIGHT-BOTTOM of Board 4 +
 
 * The Panel should now look like the following
